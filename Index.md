Welcome!

You have found the location for my Big Walkabout.
## TL;DR:

1) You can SUBSCRIBE to this page, and receive an email when I make a new post. Use the email newsletter box below to put in your email. Feel free to send this around to the folks I may have missed in my initial blast, and others who you think may be interested in following the adventure.

2) Feel free to respond to the posts. I will be doing other things than checking email, but I would love to hear your thoughts or questions.

3) The plan is to post as often as I can/want, so I have no fixed schedule. I would be super cool to have a post every week-ish, but no promises. There may be one, there may be ten, there may be more. 

4) This website is basically just an archive of old posts. Feel free to swing by and reference it, or if you are just arriving use these to catch up.

5) The dev team is just me and I am not a developer, through Gemini has been giving me a few pointers. Any issues are my own, and I will do my best to fix them while on the road (ahhh, web development).

## So What is the Plan?

I am bikepacking New Zealand! 

Bike packing is living off your bike while you ride around. It is almost exactly backpacking (what that [one movie with that hiker girl was about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_(2014_film))) but on a bike. 

And there is a lot more difference, but that is basically it. Nor am I the person to come up with the idea. There is a whole [Website]() devoted to bikepacking. So I am not the only person to do this.

Once I get there, the plan is to ~ride north~, with all the pure vibes that implies. After I ~ride north~ I will be ~riding south~. I have no route, no plan, very little itinerary, and no real intention to make one.

I think this may be the magic part of the trip
## Yeah, but who is this guy!

I am Alex Strong.

I love to:
1) make things
2) know how things work
3) move my body under its own power

I study product design (called Design) at Stanford university, and am also perusing a masters in Geology (called Earth and Planetary Science)


## So What is a Walkabout?

In the Aboriginal Australian[^1] meaning, it is a wander away from the white society to go live traditionally in the bush.

I am not Aboriginal Australian (I am American from that countries south west), nor am I going to intentionally live away from "front country" society. But I will be going on a grand adventure to "go and see", and live in a way different than my usual.

To me, a Walkabout is the kind of adventuring that sweeps you up with it. You go and put yourself into a position to make

## Footnotes:

Of course I am footnotes guy. I LOVE my footnotes.

[^1]: Technically, a Walkabout, in the strict sense, is not kiwi at all, but rather Aboriginal Australian. There exists a very large difference between Kiwi's and Aussies (as well as the Aboriginal of Australia and the Māori of New Zealand), but it seems from some Google-Fu that no equivalent to the "walkabout" exists in NZ slang, nor could I think of one in my own US slang. So for now, and likely forever, this will be my Big Walkabout.
