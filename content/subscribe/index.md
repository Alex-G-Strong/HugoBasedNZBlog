### For RSS!

If you dont know what RSS is, dont worry. Subscribe to the email and call it a day.

For those who want to dive in, RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication".  It's a way to get updates from a lot of websites without needing to visit them directly.

1. Get an RSS Reader

Here are the most popular (and free) apps:

    Phone App: NetNewsWire (simple and clean) or Feedly.
    For your Browser (chrome, edge, safari, or firefox): Inoreader or Feedbro.

2. Add My Feed
Once you have an app, just click "Add New Source" and paste this link: https://www.alexstrong.design/index.xml

3. Read at Your Own Pace
Every time I push a new post from the road, it will automatically pop up in your app. No tracking, no ads, just the writing.
