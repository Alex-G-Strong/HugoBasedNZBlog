# Howdy!

I am Alex Strong.

I love to:
1) make things
2) know how things work
3) move my body under its own power

I study product design (called Design) at Stanford university, and am also perusing a masters in Geology (called Earth and Planetary Science).

I race bikes, climb, and social dance.

I shoot photos.

I also make podcasts. I have my own show [The Story Exchange with Alex Strong](https://shows.acast.com/the-story-exchange) originally hosted on Stanford's student run radio, 90.1 KZSU. I am also an associate producer for Stanford's [State of the Human](https://stateofthehuman.podbean.com/page/2/) podcast.

I'm a photographer and storyteller currently traversing the landscapes of New Zealand. This blog is a digital scrapbook of my "Big Walkabout"—a place to share the quiet moments, the rugged trails, and the unique sounds of the wilderness.

### The Gear

A Specialized Crux, setup for bike packing. 

I made half the bags myself.

Am I pushing it a bit on the weight limit, but hopefully it works out!
