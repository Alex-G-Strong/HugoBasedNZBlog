Welcome! If you are here, you found the summit log, and this website. When you get the chance, head on back and leave a message. The other folks in the field would love to hear from.

This project is a collection of photos taken from 2024, 2025 and in the upcoming 2026 field seasons. The photos were taken by me Alex Strong on film of various types. 

The goal was to capture poleta - the place, and the people, and the magic that being in the field offers. Hopefully, these photos take you, dear mapper, back to your own mapping course, and its own magic.

### 2024 photos:
